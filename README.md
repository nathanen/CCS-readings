This is a syllabus for a PhD level seminar focused on the intersection of Informatics and STS (science and technology studies).  The primary audience is our PhD students in the [Computing, Culture, and Society][ccs] research group in the Informatics department of the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University, but it can be adapted to a wide variety of graduate-level contexts.  An Overleaf project and PDF version can be found [here][overleaf]
